\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is a Proof of Concept implementation of the attacks described in the paper \'93TEnK-U: Terrorist Attacks for Fake Exposure Notification in Contact Tracing Systems\'94 (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1150.pdf). Most of the libraries used for deployment are available for testing, therefore exposed to possible bugs.\
We highly recommend to not to use our smart contracts for different reason than verifying, in a testing environment, that our attacks can be successful.}
