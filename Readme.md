# TEnK-U Smart Contract Suite

This is a Proof of Concept implementation of the attacks described in the paper TEnK-U: Terrorist Attacks for Fake Exposure Notification in Contact Tracing Systems (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1150.pdf).
Most of the libraries used for deployment are available for testing, therefore exposed to possible bugs.
We highly recommend to not to use our smart contracts for different reason than verifying, in a testing environment, that our attacks can be successful.

## Libraries used

The following extra smart contract libraries are used:
* Elliptic Curve Solidity - https://github.com/tdrerup/elliptic-curve-solidity
* Base64 Library - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-jwt/blob/master/contracts/Base64.sol
* ProtoBuf Library - https://github.com/lazyledger/protobuf3-solidity-lib
* Ethereum DateTime - https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-datetime
* Solidity Bytes Utils - https://github.com/GNSPS/solidity-bytes-utils
